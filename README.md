# AtomicLabs
In this repository I develop a mobile app for the company Atomic Labs. This as a test to be able to join their team.
This app was made with React Native Cli. Visual Studio Code and Android Studio were used for the development of the App

# Instructions
# First steps
First you have to open the project inside a console, I use Git Bash for convenience. Then you must run the "npm start" command. It is recommended that this command be executed only in its own console

# Second
Now you need to open another console inside the project. Then you must run the "npm android" command. Once this is done, the android emulator will open, and the app will be installed.
Once it is installed it will start running in our emulator

# Troubles
If you have any problems with the app in the emulator, you should run the following commands in the console.
First "cd android" and then "./gradlew clean" this is for Check dependencies, compile and package.

And the other option is: uninstall the app from the emulator and re-run the first commands "npm start" "npm run"
